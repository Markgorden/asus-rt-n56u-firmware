IMPORTANT WARNING

Cutter has been designed for use as a administrators tool for Linux
firewalls. It's use (as is, or modified) for any other purpose is not
sanctioned by the author. So - do not use this tool as a parachute, or

This software has been designed for "legal" and "appropriate" use
by network security administrators and the like. It has been written as
part of a larger Linux firewall project, targetting at controlling traffic
from peer-to-peer software such as Kazaa, iMesh and others into and out of
a private network. It is not designed as a tool for malicious use and the
author in no way sanctions such use.

Users of the software should be aware that it's actions are easily detectable
using a number of readily available network monitoring tools, and it makes no
attempt to disguise it's actions. Malicious use of "cutter" could result in a
jail sentance in a number of countries around the world.
